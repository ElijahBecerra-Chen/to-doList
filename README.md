<h1 align="center"> To-do Listüìù </h1>

<br>

>  So far, I've learned HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.2(*Not used in this work*), JavaScript, DOM manipulation, <br>Git + Github with ZTM (*Since 2022-Apr.*) and have been learning all the skills of becoming a Web Developer (Fullstack). I was trying to make a work that contains the design objectives that I set and wanted this to be the original version. To grow my learning and to optimize the To-do List, I expect to receive more advice from friends, family, and enthusiastic strangers. To make sure that I keep improving my skills, I'll try to add the functions that people expect to see and solve the problems I  encounter.

## Design objective üéØ
<br>

1. **RWD & UI/UX**

  * Can be used on mobile or desktop (vertical, horizontal, when the screen size is being adjusted).
  * Clean, simple, comfortable interface.
  
  <br>
  
2. **Functions**

  * Cursor becomes a pointer while hovering on the list items, so the user can notice that it has a function. <br>When users click on the item it toggles the linethrough.
  * Has a button that can help delete items.
  * DeleteButton shows after linethrough appears.

## Problems on the queue that need to be fixed and optimizedüí™üèª

<br>

> After some testing by family and friends, I've recieved some pretty useful advice<br> To be honest, they're all challenging to me... for now.<br>However, I'll optimize the items down below and push them up in the future.

<br>

* A function that reminds users of the upcoming To-dos.
* An edit function instead of having only the done/delete button.
* Category section that allows users to be able to arrange the To-dos by priority.
* A function for users to upload images.
* An undo function.
* Changeable background image to user's own liking.
* A section that keeps the already done To-dos, so users can feel good seeing their progress.
