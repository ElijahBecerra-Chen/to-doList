<h1 align="center"> To-do Listüìù </h1>

<br>

>  So far, I've learned HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.2(*Not being used in this work*), JavaScript, DOM manipulation, <br>Git + Github with ZTM (*Since 2022-Apr.*) and have been learning all the skills of becoming a Web Developer (Fullstack). I was trying to make a work that contains the design objectives that I made and wanted this to be the original version. To see the learning growth and to optimize the To-do List, I expect to receive more advice from friends, family, or even strangers. And to make sure that I keep improving my skills, I'll try to add the functions that people expect to see and solve those problems I'm going to encounter.

## Design objective üéØ
<br>

1. **RWD & UI/UX**

  * Can be used on mobile or desktop(Vertical, Horizontal, when the screen size is beeing adjusted).
  * Clean, simple, comfortable interface.
  * The list items will still be pretty organized even if the content is long and the content will not<br> be out of the background brick. 
  
  <br>
  
2. **Functional**

  * The titles, input area and button will not be moving around when the list is getting longer.
  * Cursor becomes a pointer while hovering on the list items so the user can notice that it has a function,<br> and when users click on the item, it toggles the linethrough.
  * Has a button that can help deleting the items.
  * DeleteButton shows after users click on the item and shows the linethrough.

## Problems on the queue that need to be fixed and be optimizedüí™üèª

<br>

> After some testing by family and friends, I've recieved some pretty useful advice<br> ( To be honest, they're all challenging to me "For now" ).<br>However, I'll get back and work on optimize the items on the list in the future.

<br>

* A function that reminds users the upcoming To-dos.
* An edit function instead of having only the done/delete button.
* Category section that for users to be able to arrange the To-dos by priority.
* A function for users to upload images.
* An undo function.
* Changeable background image by user's own liking.
* A section that keeps the already done To-dos ( So users can feel good seeing their progress )
